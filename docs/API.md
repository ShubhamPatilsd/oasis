## Documentation on the `api` package

## The `api` package is built to be used in `web`

**The `api` package is the Oasis GraphQL API**. It is built to be integrated into the `web` package. `web` has `@oasis/api` as a dependency.
The scripts below are to be used before running `web`.

## The `build` script

The `build` script runs the typescript compiler which generates the types and the javascript output of the `api` package. **This is ideal when you just need to run `web` and want to avoid touching the `api` package**

## The `watch` script

The `watch` script uses the typescript compiler in watch mode. This means every time a change is made to a file inside `api`, a new build is generated.
**This is ideal while developing, editing or debugging `api`.**
