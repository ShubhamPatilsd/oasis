3. Install all packages with the `yarn` command in the project root.

### Firebase: Getting Started

1. Head over to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and create a project, enable **firestore database**, and then, get your credentials. [Don't know how?](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/how-to-create-firebase-web-app-get/) 
2. Copy and paste the values into the `.env.example` file where you can update the boilerplate text, as well as rename `.env.example` to `.env`.

### Firebase: OAuth

1. Head over to your firebase console
2. On the sidebar, click "Authentication" and go to the "Sign-in Method" tab
3. Now scroll to where it says "GitHub" and click it
4. If it's disabled click "enable", then go to <a href="https://github.com/settings/developers">GitHub's Developer Settings</a> and click "New OAuth App" at the top right
5. Next make a OAuth App and fill in the fields, and get the `Client ID + Client Secret`, go back to Firebase
6. Make sure you have the credentials copied, paste them into Firebase
7. At the bottom copy the callback URL and paste that in the GitHub Developer Settings spot for it
8. Click "Save", and you will be good to go!

## Next Steps + Reminders:

- You can start the development server using `yarn dev`
- Make your changes!
- We are using Yarn as our package manager, please do not commit your ```package-lock.json``` files from NPM
- Everytime you change the .env file, you need to restart the server
- Make sure you are upto date by doing ```git pull``` here and there
- Submit a <a href="https://github.com/heybereket/oasis/pulls">pull request</a>!
